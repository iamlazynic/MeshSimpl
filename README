Mesh simplification implementation

- Restriction on input:
    - Cannot handle non-manifold mesh
    - Cannot handle mesh with wrong oriented face

- Simplification flaws:
    - Not able to change topology

- To-do-next:
    - Use OOP better to improve program
        - neighborhood
    - Topo-change simplify
