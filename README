Mesh simplification implementation

- Restriction on input:
    - Cannot handle non-manifold mesh
    - Cannot handle mesh with wrong oriented face

- Simplification flaws:
    - Not able to change topology

- To-do-next:
    - Use OOP better to improve program
        - neighborhood
    - Topo-change simplify
    - SoA structure


Naming
    class:          Erasable
    typedef:        Indices
    member:         Faces.replaceSide(1)
    private member: _indices
    file name:      for class Indices:  Indices.{ch}pp
                    for non class:      utils.{ch}pp

Terms
    faces incident to some edge are its wings
    edges around a face are its sides
    vertices of an edge are its endpoints
    edges of a vertex are its ???
    faces of a vertex are its ???
    vertices of a face are its corners
