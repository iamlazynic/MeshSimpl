Mesh simplification implementation

* While the library (src subdirectory) does not have any dependency,
  building example needs ``libigl'' to read/write/visualize mesh data

- Restriction on input:
    - Cannot handle non-manifold mesh
    - Cannot handle mesh with wrong oriented face

- Simplification flaws:
    - Not able to change topology
